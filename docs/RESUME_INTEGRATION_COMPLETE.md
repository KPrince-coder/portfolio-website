## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Option 1: Reset database (will clear existing data)
npx supabase db reset

# Option 2: Apply specific migration
npx supabase migration up
```

### 2. Test the Admin Interface

1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Click on "Resume" in the sidebar
3. Test all CRUD operations
4. Verify date validations
5. Test array management (achievements/activities)
6. Verify RLS policies work correctly

### 3. Update Frontend Resume.tsx (Future)

The current `src/components/Resume.tsx` has hardcoded data. Next step would be to:

- Create a custom hook `useResumeData.ts` to fetch from database
- Update Resume.tsx to use the hook
- Add loading and error states
- Match the database structure

### 4. Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Add image upload for company/school logos
