## Integration Steps

### 1. Update Admin Sidebar

Add Resume link to the admin navigation:

```tsx
// In src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx
import { FileText } from "lucide-react";

// Add to navigation items
{
  to: "/admin/resume",
  icon: FileText,
  label: "Resume",
}
```

### 2. Update Admin Router

Add Resume route to admin routing:

```tsx
// In admin routing file
import { ResumeManagementRouter } from "@/components/admin/resume";

<Route path="resume/*" element={<ResumeManagementRouter />} />
```

### 3. Run Migration

Apply the resume migration:

```bash
