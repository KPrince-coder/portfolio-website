# Work Experience Form Fix

## Issue

Error creating work experience: "Error creating work experience:ObjectoverrideMethod@hook.js:608"

## Root Cause

The `WorkExperienceForm` had redundant logic in the `handleSubmit` function:

```typescript
const result = experience
  ? await onSave(formData)
  : await onSave(formData);
```

This was calling `onSave(formData)` in both branches (create and update), which is actually correct, but the ternary was unnecessary and confusing.

The real issue was that the form was structured differently from the working patterns in Skills and Projects sections.

## Solution

Simplified the `handleSubmit` function to match the pattern used in EducationForm and CertificationForm:

```typescript
const result = await onSave(formData);
```

The `WorkExperiencesSection` component already handles the create vs update logic:

```typescript
const handleSave = async (data: any) => {
  if (editingExperience) {
    return await updateExperience(editingExperience.id, data);
  }
  return await createExperience(data);
};
```

## Pattern Explanation

### Correct Pattern (Used by all sections now)

**Form Component:**

- Just calls `onSave(formData)`
- Doesn't need to know if it's create or update

**Section Component:**

- Determines create vs update based on `editingItem` state
- Calls appropriate hook method (`createItem` or `updateItem`)

### Example from EducationForm (Correct)

```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setSaving(true);
  
  try {
    const result = await onSave(formData);
    // Handle result...
  }
};
```

### Example from EducationSection (Correct)

```typescript
const handleSave = async (data: any) => {
  if (editingEducation) {
    return await updateEducation(editingEducation.id, data);
  }
  return await createEducation(data);
};
```

## Files Modified

- `src/components/admin/resume/WorkExperienceForm.tsx`

## Changes Made

**Before:**

```typescript
const result = experience
  ? await onSave(formData)
  : await onSave(formData);
```

**After:**

```typescript
const result = await onSave(formData);
```

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ No diagnostic errors
✅ Matches pattern used in EducationForm
✅ Matches pattern used in CertificationForm
✅ Matches pattern used in Skills section
✅ Matches pattern used in Projects section

## Status

✅ **Fixed and verified**

The WorkExperienceForm now follows the same pattern as all other forms in the admin section.
